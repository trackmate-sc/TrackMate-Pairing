# TrackMate-Pairing

A tool that allows for pairing together two [TrackMate](https://github.com/trackmate-sc/TrackMate) files, based on several distance metrics. 
It builds pairs taken from the tracks of one file and the tracks of a second file. 
This is used mainly to study how the distance of objects detected in two different channels evolve over time.
